The Korean language is related to Japanese and Mongolian.
Although it differs grammatically from Chinese and does not use tones, a large number of Chinese cognates exist in Korean.
Chinese ideograms are believed to have been brought into Korea sometime before the second century BC.
The learned class spoke Korean, but read and wrote Chinese.
